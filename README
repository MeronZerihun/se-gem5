# EMTD gem5 #

This repo houses the modifications made to gem5 to support simulating EMTD-compliant hardware. 

## Building Gem5

If building on an OS with gcc version 6+ (cough, Ubuntu 18.04) (note that you must have gcc v5 installed as well to force it to use it):

```bash
scons CC=gcc-5 CXX=g++-5 -j<num_build_threads> build/RISCV/gem5.opt
```

If building on an older OS with gcc version < 6 already installed:

```bash
scons -j<num_build_threads> build/RISCV/gem5.opt
```

## Running FS 
# Add file using mount
To run benchmarks in full system mode, the benchmark files must be on the disk image. You can mount the disk using the following command:
```bash
sudo mount -o loop,offset=32256 linux-x86.img temp-mount-dir
```

After the disk is mounted, you can copy files to it and the unmount using the following commands:
```bash
sudo cp bmk-file temp-mount-dir/desired-dir
```

```bash
sudo unmoung temp-mount-dir
```

# Run a benchmark in full system mode
To execute a benchmark in full system mode, create an .rcS file containing the terminal commands to execute that benchmark:
```bash
./desired-dir/bmk
/sbin/m5 exit # Terminates simulator 
```

This .rcS file is passed to the gem5 simulator using the --script flag:
```bash
~/path-to-gem5/clean-gem5/build/X86/gem5.opt ~/path-to-gem5/clean-gem5/configs/fs/test-fs/run.py --script run.rcS
```

On exit, the stats file is written and the console output is be saved to a .device file in m5out. 




## Original README Contents

This is the gem5 simulator.

The main website can be found at http://www.gem5.org

A good starting point is http://www.gem5.org/Introduction, and for
more information about building the simulator and getting started
please see http://www.gem5.org/Documentation and
http://www.gem5.org/Tutorials.

To build gem5, you will need the following software: g++ or clang,
Python (gem5 links in the Python interpreter), SCons, SWIG, zlib, m4,
and lastly protobuf if you want trace capture and playback
support. Please see http://www.gem5.org/Dependencies for more details
concerning the minimum versions of the aforementioned tools.

Once you have all dependencies resolved, type 'scons
build/<ARCH>/gem5.opt' where ARCH is one of ALPHA, ARM, NULL, MIPS,
POWER, SPARC, or X86. This will build an optimized version of the gem5
binary (gem5.opt) for the the specified architecture. See
http://www.gem5.org/Build_System for more details and options.

With the simulator built, have a look at
http://www.gem5.org/Running_gem5 for more information on how to use
gem5.

The basic source release includes these subdirectories:
   - configs: example simulation configuration scripts
   - ext: less-common external packages needed to build gem5
   - src: source code of the gem5 simulator
   - system: source for some optional system software for simulated systems
   - tests: regression tests
   - util: useful utility programs and files

To run full-system simulations, you will need compiled system firmware
(console and PALcode for Alpha), kernel binaries and one or more disk
images. Please see the gem5 download page for these items at
http://www.gem5.org/Download

If you have questions, please send mail to gem5-users@gem5.org

Enjoy using gem5 and please share your modifications and extensions.
